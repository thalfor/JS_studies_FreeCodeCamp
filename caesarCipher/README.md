# Ceasar Cipher

This was a [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) JS Project [(link)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/caesars-cipher) that was required to complete the course [Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/).

## Logic

the cipher's logic is to take a word or sentence and add 13 positions in the alphabet to each letter it has.

So in this way the code maps the alphabet as an array and adds 13 positions to each element looping the alphabet if necessary.
