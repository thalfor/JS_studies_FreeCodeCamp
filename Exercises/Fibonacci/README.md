# Finding Fibonacci number sequence

in this project we have to find the number in Fibonacci's sequence that corresponds to the number inputed.

## Important notice

you'll see that we have 2 codes here, one done with loop and another one with iteration.

Loop:

- we here just use the logic Number + LastNumber "n" amount of times to find the respective number. It's the same logic as the sequence itself.

Iteration:

- we'll use the same logic as before but instead of looping we'll stack the function over and over again.
- this one has a problem, when the number is high enough the stacking procedure will crash due to memory overload. So in this case stacking may not be the best solution even though it's commonly said to be better.
