# JS Studies

This repository wass created to keep my small JS projects and studies organized in a way that it will help not only me but others that wish to dive into JS a little.

## Folders

We have two types of folders here:

- FS, HTTP, PATH: this ones are for studies about the respective subjects in JS.
- all of the other are projects / exercises.

## Exercises

To conclude this [FreeCodeCamp Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/) about JavaScript i had to deliver 5 projects:

- Palindrome Checker
- Roman Numeral Converter
- Caesars Cipher
- Telephone Number Validator
- Cash Register
