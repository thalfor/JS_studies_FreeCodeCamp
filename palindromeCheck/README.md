# Is it a Palindrome?

This was a [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) JS Project [(link)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/palindrome-checker) that was required to complete the course [Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/).

## Logic

The code replaces special characters and uses the .reverse() to see if the original is the same as after.
